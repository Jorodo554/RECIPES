    <h2><em>Recipe</em></h2>
     <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)</li>
     </ul>

     <h2><em>Preparation procedure</em></h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved. </li>
        <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.</li>
        <li>Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.</li>
